Aug 29 04:00:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <6piz7wk> a) Release all the files needed to build and fork the hardware as open-source under modified GPLv3 license that states that the freedom to redistribute and use is restricted until the development cost is recovered with a transparent accounting for public review that can be used as a proof of fulfilling the license agreement (The general approach with OSHW hardware with proposed legal management)
Aug 29 04:00:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <6piz7wk> b) Do not release any hardware files until the development cost is covered - Creality's approach e.g. see Creality Ender-3 on https://github.com/Creality3DPrinting/Ender-3
Aug 29 04:00:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <6piz7wk> 
Aug 29 04:00:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <6piz7wk> While adding a voluntary added cost to the store after the development has been paid and crowd sourcing options
Aug 29 04:00:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <6piz7wk> 
Aug 29 04:00:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <6piz7wk> Because this way PINE64 will be able to establish a sustainable income with passive public relation and marketing management to enable more work and redistribution of spare parts that are currently insufficient to make RockPro64 lesser alternative to raspberry pi in the EU

Aug 29 04:01:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <6piz7wk> there are more economical adjustments that can be made e.g. the codeberg approach where people will be allowed to cooperate on the company's management by paying e.g. 5 EUR a month to join e.g. discourse where they can be an active part of the company
Aug 29 04:01:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <6piz7wk> .. which i personally thing would be a great thing for PINE64

Aug 29 14:06:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <distra> the jh7110 in star64 doesnt have eDP for display like the pinebook currently uses
Aug 29 14:06:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <distra> and the mipi dsi only goes up to 1080p30hz
Aug 29 14:07:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <distra> so it would need to use it's hdmi output
