Aug 29 13:45:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <mikaelm> Oh by the way, previously I mentioned some pixels were not visible on the external monitor -
Aug 29 13:45:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <mikaelm> That was a monitor issue and fixed it.
Aug 29 13:46:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <JC_Bass> I have officially join the pinephone club. Broke the 4th pin on the sim adapter because "plug it in and it works" wasn't fun enough and had to play with it one to many times.
Aug 29 13:47:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <JC_Bass> From 15 minutes of googling it seems like this is a common problem. Ordered some good sim adapters to hopefully avoid this in the future.
Aug 29 13:48:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <JC_Bass> What's the chance pf getting some kind of warranty? I don't mind replacing the mainboard or even just the sim tray if I could get ahold of one.

Aug 29 14:02:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <mikaelm> What if the PPP's lower PCB with the USBC port breaks, is it sold as a replacement? @tl_lim

Aug 29 14:12:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Phalio> @Michael that usually means that the keyboard battery is empty or was shut off with the button. is that with or without a charging cable plugged into the keyboard?
Aug 29 14:12:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Michael> Both
Aug 29 14:15:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <mikaelm> ApEk: Mobian bundles version 102.2 . What's the most straightforward way for me to get hold of release 105 or later (re @p64protocolbot: [D] <ApEk> mikaelm, I believe that bug is why hw accel is not enabled in firefox for ppp. (at least until branch 105 release))
Aug 29 14:16:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <mikaelm> hmm there can be backports hmm
Aug 29 14:20:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Michael> I dont know if its just stuck in sleep mode or something but it was fully charged before i put it in sleep mode so its either stuck or something on the charging board is fried.
Aug 29 14:26:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <ideasquarebased> @megi1 i am running from console
