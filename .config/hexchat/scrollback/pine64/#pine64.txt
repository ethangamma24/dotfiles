T 1661760026 18<P64ProtocolBot18>	13[M] <6piz7wk> a) Release all the files needed to build and fork the hardware as open-source under modified GPLv3 license that states that the freedom to redistribute and use is restricted until the development cost is recovered with a transparent accounting for public review that can be used as a proof of fulfilling the license agreement (The general approach with OSHW hardware with proposed legal management)
T 1661760028 18<P64ProtocolBot18>	13[M] <6piz7wk> b) Do not release any hardware files until the development cost is covered - Creality's approach e.g. see Creality Ender-3 on https://github.com/Creality3DPrinting/Ender-3

T 1661760034 18<P64ProtocolBot18>	13[M] <6piz7wk> Because this way PINE64 will be able to establish a sustainable income with passive public relation and marketing management to enable more work and redistribution of spare parts that are currently insufficient to make RockPro64 lesser alternative to raspberry pi in the EU

T 1661760069 18<P64ProtocolBot18>	13[M] <6piz7wk> there are more economical adjustments that can be made e.g. the codeberg approach where people will be allowed to cooperate on the company's management by paying e.g. 5 EUR a month to join e.g. discourse where they can be an active part of the company
